## Dependencies

- Conan (1.59.0)

## :hammer_and_wrench: Build

To run this project you can use a script

```bash
./project.py --install --build --run
```

or you can run commands from script manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
conan install -if ./conanfiles -pr:b=default --build=missing ./

# Build project
conan build -if ./conanfiles ./

# Run resulting binary
./build/Release/cpp_template
```
